We developed a machine learning model that can predict the NCAA match result with 78% accuracy, which is a good result that shows the possibility of using ANN in this concept. The new data set was created by scraping 2023 NCAA teams for each individual game and gathered up in one table with 1131 match results with details. This document was uploaded on Kaggle for future investigation and public usage. The overall 363 team was evaluated by 8 different features and statistics, and the one predicted by the ANN tensor flow model had the best chance of winning. the user-interactive application created for all 363 teams in all different conferences to show the result by choosing the two teams and team number one venue. The model predicts the probability of winning for the first team.
