st.write(""" ### Most Effective Defensive Factors ##  """)

st.write("""
  In NCAA basketball, there are several factors that can contribute to a team's defensive effectiveness. Some of the most effective defensive factors include:
Field Goal Percentage Defense: The ability to limit the opposing team's shooting percentage is a key factor in a team's defensive success.
Turnovers Forced: Teams that can force turnovers and convert them into points can have a significant impact on the outcome of a game.
Rebounding: Teams that can control the boards and limit second-chance opportunities for their opponents can be very effective on defense and so on.

In this sectin we name the most effective Defensive Factores that we used in our data sets and tried to evaluate each one of them with sensitivity analysis of model we created to show which one of the is more important and has bigger influenced on match result.

st.write(""" Offensive Rebound Rate (ORR) is a statistic used in basketball to measure the percentage of missed shots by a team that are rebounded by that same team. Specifically, it is the number of offensive rebounds divided by the total number of missed field goals and missed free throws by that team.

ORR is a useful statistic because offensive rebounds can lead to second-chance scoring opportunities, which can be critical in close games. A team with a high ORR is generally considered to be more effective at controlling the boards and generating additional scoring opportunities.

ORR can be calculated for individual players as well as for teams. The formula for ORR is:

ORR = Offensive rebounds / (Offensive rebounds + Opponents' defensive rebounds)

st.write(""" ### Adjusted Defensive Efficiency     ##  """)

st.write(""" Adjusted Offensive Efficiency (AOE) is a basketball statistic that measures how effectively a team scores points per possession, while accounting for the strength of the opposing team's defense. AOE is typically calculated by taking a team's points scored per 100 possessions and adjusting that number based on the strength of the opposing team's defense, as well as the pace of the game.
One commonly used method for calculating AOE is to use the formula:      

  AOE = (Points Scored / Possessions) * (League Average Efficiency / Opponent's Defensive Efficiency)     
  
By adjusting for the strength of the opposing team's defense and the pace of the game, AOE provides a more accurate measure of a team's offensive performance than simply looking at their raw points scored per game.

st.write(""" ### Effective Field Goal Percentage Allowed  ##  """)

st.write(""" Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%) is a basketball statistic that measures a player's shooting efficiency. It is a modification of the traditional Field Goal Percentage (FG%), which only takes into account two-point field goals and three-point field goals.
In contrast, eFG% takes into account the fact that three-point field goals are worth more than two-point field goals. The formula for eFG% is:  

eFG% = (FGM + 0.5 * 3PM) / FGA  

where FGM is the number of field goals made, 3PM is the number of three-point field goals made, and FGA is the number of field goal attempts.  
By adding 0.5 times the number of three-pointers made to the number of two-pointers made in the numerator, eFG% effectively weights three-pointers as if they were 1.5 two-pointers. This provides a more accurate picture of a player's shooting efficiency and helps to compare players who shoot a different mix of two-pointers and three-pointers.  
eFG% is particularly useful for evaluating players who are efficient at shooting three-pointers. For example, a player who shoots 50% on two-point field goals and 33% on three-point field goals would have a FG% of 43.3%, which is below average. However, their eFG% would be 51.7%, which is above average because their three-pointers are weighted more heavily.

st.write(""" Turnover Percentage Committed, also known as Steal Rate, is a basketball statistic that measures the percentage of possessions in which a player commits a steal. It is calculated as follows:

Steal Rate = (Steals x (Team Minutes / 5)) / Minutes Played

Steal Rate is used to evaluate a player's defensive ability and effectiveness in causing turnovers. A high Steal Rate indicates that a player is skilled at anticipating and disrupting passing lanes, and is successful at stealing the ball from opposing players.
