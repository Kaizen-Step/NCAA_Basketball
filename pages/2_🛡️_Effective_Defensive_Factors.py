st.write(""" ### Most Effective Defensive Factors ##  """)

st.write("""
  In NCAA basketball, there are several factors that can contribute to a team's defensive effectiveness. Some of the most effective defensive factors include:
Field Goal Percentage Defense: The ability to limit the opposing team's shooting percentage is a key factor in a team's defensive success.
Turnovers Forced: Teams that can force turnovers and convert them into points can have a significant impact on the outcome of a game.
Rebounding: Teams that can control the boards and limit second-chance opportunities for their opponents can be very effective on defense and so on.

In this sectin we name the most effective Defensive Factores that we used in our data sets and tried to evaluate each one of them with sensitivity analysis of model we created to show which one of the is more important and has bigger influenced on match result.

st.write(""" ### Adjusted Defensive Efficiency     ##  """)

st.write(""" Adjusted Defensive Efficiency (ADE) is a statistical metric used in basketball to evaluate the effectiveness of a team's defense. ADE takes into account the number of points a team allows per possession, while adjusting for the strength of the opposing team's offense.
To calculate ADE, the total points allowed by a team is divided by the total number of possessions their opponents had during the season, giving the team's Points Allowed Per Possession (PAPP) statistic. This number is then adjusted based on the strength of the opponents' offenses by subtracting the average PAPP of those offenses. The resulting number is the team's Adjusted Defensive Efficiency.
ADE is considered a more accurate measure of a team's defensive ability than simply looking at the total points allowed over the course of a season, as it accounts for the quality of the teams faced.

st.write(""" ### Effective Field Goal Percentage Allowed  ##  """)

st.write(""" Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%) is a basketball statistic that measures a player's shooting efficiency. It is a modification of the traditional Field Goal Percentage (FG%), which only takes into account two-point field goals and three-point field goals.
In contrast, eFG% takes into account the fact that three-point field goals are worth more than two-point field goals. The formula for eFG% is:  

eFG% = (FGM + 0.5 * 3PM) / FGA  

where FGM is the number of field goals made, 3PM is the number of three-point field goals made, and FGA is the number of field goal attempts.  
By adding 0.5 times the number of three-pointers made to the number of two-pointers made in the numerator, eFG% effectively weights three-pointers as if they were 1.5 two-pointers. This provides a more accurate picture of a player's shooting efficiency and helps to compare players who shoot a different mix of two-pointers and three-pointers.  
eFG% is particularly useful for evaluating players who are efficient at shooting three-pointers. For example, a player who shoots 50% on two-point field goals and 33% on three-point field goals would have a FG% of 43.3%, which is below average. However, their eFG% would be 51.7%, which is above average because their three-pointers are weighted more heavily.

st.write(""" Turnover Percentage Committed, also known as Steal Rate, is a basketball statistic that measures the percentage of possessions in which a player commits a steal. It is calculated as follows:

Steal Rate = (Steals x (Team Minutes / 5)) / Minutes Played

Where "Team Minutes" refers to the total number of minutes played by the player's team, and "Minutes Played" refers to the total number of minutes played by the player.
Steal Rate is used to evaluate a player's defensive ability and effectiveness in causing turnovers. A high Steal Rate indicates that a player is skilled at anticipating and disrupting passing lanes, and is successful at stealing the ball from opposing players.

st.write(""" ### Free Throw Rate Allowed     ##  """)

st.write(""" Free Throw Rate (FTR) is a basketball statistic that measures how often a team attempts free throws in relation to their field goal attempts. It is calculated by dividing the number of free throw attempts by the number of field goal attempts.

The formula for Free Throw Rate is:

FTR = Free Throw Attempts / Field Goal Attempts

The resulting FTR value is a ratio, expressed as a decimal or a percentage. A higher FTR indicates that a team is more aggressive in attacking the basket and drawing fouls, which can be advantageous since free throws are uncontested shots that can lead to points without using the clock.
Free throw rate can be used to analyze a team's offensive strategy and the effectiveness of individual players in drawing fouls and getting to the free-throw line.
